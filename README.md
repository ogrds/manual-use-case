This project was created by [Me](https://ogrds.dev/) for a technical interview.

Explaining the code, I created this using [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) on version `14.2.3`. This project consists in a Landing page that show some information about [Manual](https://manual.com/) and provide a CTA that open a quiz for the user check if the product can fit in their case.

- All the code shows in the same path `/`;
- When the user click on CTA, the quiz is open in the same page;
- When is the first interaction with the questions, the buttons "Previous" and "Next" are not visible. According the user choose an option, they have the option to back to the previous question and change their answer. This action might change the result;
- To create the styles, I used `tailwind` for a fast implementation and best adjust for all devices;
- The json content was provided in a file for not show loadings for the user;
- Use `npm` to install dependencies and run the project;
- The project was deployed on [Vercel](https://vercel.com/) and the link is [https://manual-use-case.vercel.app/](https://manual-use-case.vercel.app/)
